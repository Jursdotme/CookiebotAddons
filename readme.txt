Cookiebot integrations to other plugins. The addons hook into the original plugins and render their cookie setting tags, so that prior consent is obeyed. No manual editing of plugins is needed.

## Description ##

Cookiebot Addons has been put in place to accommodate Cookiebot users who do not want to patch their plugins manually, as these patches will be lost when new updates to the plugin arrive.

We offer no guarantee that these addons will work forever. If the owners of our supported plugins make breaking changes, an addon may well fail. On the administration page, you have the option to turn an addon off, until a fix has been released.

If your favorite plugin is not supported, you can ask the developers of your plugin to make an integration, either directly to Cookiebot, or through our [Github repository](https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotAddons).

You can also ask us through the support forum, but we do not guarantee that we will have time to do it.
